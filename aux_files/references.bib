annote = {1. - INTRODUCTION
Paragraph 1: seasonal - tc genesis - local weather
Paragraph 2: short mention of pacific waves different so we'll move on. 
Paragraph 3: Instabilities and Jet
Paragraph 4: Observational study : basic characteristics
Paragraph 5: Modelling - instabilities of the jet. dominated by barotropic energy conversions. simple diabatic parameterisation minor changes tho possible in the right direction.
Paragraph 6: Amplitude and non-linearity of the waves, not really sure what this paragraph is arguing?
Paragraph 7: model description and overview of paper. 

2. - LARGE-SCALE MEAN CHARACTERISTICS

Paragraph 1: Mean large scale characteristics
Paragraph 2: Brief AEJ,TEJ
Paragraph 3: Follow the crowd and deal with only the AEJ


3. - OBSERVED CHARACTERISTICS OF EASTERLY WAVES

a. Energetics
Paragraph 1: Observational composite wave of GATE, not growing, smoothed. Equal Baroclinic (CE) and Barotropic (CK). CK more important over land, CE over Ocean. 
Paragraph 2: Modelling studies confirm baroclinic over barotropic
Paragraph 3: Linear studies suggest CK similar to East Atlantic where waves are most non-linear. Confusion?

b. Synoptic Structure of easterly waves
Paragraph 1: Equatorward of jet SW-NE tilt consistent with CK growth. 2 Vort maxes in NW-SE location. Noted by Reed.
Paragraph 2: Vertical tilts consistent with baroclinic growth, tho southern vort is more vertical suggesting more important latent heating role.

c. Observed Life Cycle of An Easterly Wave.
Paragraph 1: Form Over Eastern Africa, reach max amplitude at West Coast. 
Paragraph 2: If formed at {\textasciitilde}25E would have a continental lifetime of {\textasciitilde}6.5 days. is 6-8 days natural life-cycle time or is it lack of supportive basic state. 
Paragraph 3: Doubling times based on Energy conversions, EKE doubling of {\textasciitilde}2 days. linear growth rate of {\textasciitilde}0.4d
Paragraph 4: Importance of initial disturbance and of moisture and possible latenet heat release. 

4. NORMAL MODE STUDY

a. zonal mean flow
Paragraph 1: Only consider AEJ, no low-level westerlies. reverse temperature gradient of {\textasciitilde}5K per 1000km
Paragraph 2: Charney-Stern Change of sign of PV gradient, satisfied in the horizonal and vertical. surface Theta and negative Q also satisfies criterion b. 
Paragraph 3: Fjortoft condition, U correlated with q and theta gradients. 
Paragraph 4: Expected tilt of rossby waves on pv gradients and theta gradients
Paragraph 5: Smaller Wavelength would decouple jet from surface so only PV gradient interactions would be expected
Paragaph 6: Equatorward flank stronger gradient - stronger troughs
Paragraph 7: Ertel PV confirms linear instability and gradients. 

b. Method and Model
Paragraph 1: Baroclinic Spectral Model - t95 with 15 levels
Paragraph 2: details of the growth of the pertubation  - similar to simmons 75
paragraph 3: details of Latent heating section, smalled relative change in growth requirement.
Paragraph 4: Dry weakly growing high wavenumbers had decreased growth rate, issue with vertical resolution possible an issue with previous studies also. 

c. Results
i. 
Maximum growth rate at wavenumber 10-11, decreasing phase speed with increasing wavenumber. 
ii. 
Energy conversion of wavenumber 10 - v max of 5 m/s
Zonal kinectic energy seems to be the greatest source ( Basic state Kinectic to EKE is Barotropic, basic state potential to EKE is baroclinic)
Dominant energy conversion is CK (CK/CE = 5.6) resemble over ocean. This increases with increasing wave number, more jet action less surface.
iii.
Paragraph 1: EKE max on both sides of jet and weak at surface in theta gradient
Paragraph 2: equator boundary might be funky, tho small.
Paragraph 3: Easterly Momentum fluxed away from jet. CK. Nothern Flank is deeper. 
Paragraph 4: Oversations show slightly weaker numbers. 
Paragraph 5:
