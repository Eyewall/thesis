ADD A FILE TO REPOSITORY: git add myfile.txt

COMMIT CHANGES: git commit -a -m "My first commit"

VIEW HISTORY: git log

SHOW CHANGES: git show ID --word-diff=color
              git show 11b7dd6bbb05f5bee771eb8d889df37989c1c240 --word-diff=color

RESTORE TO EARLIER VERS: git checkout ID .
                         git checkout 11b7dd6bbb05f5bee771eb8d889df37989c1c240 .
			 The files in your project now have their contents restored
                         to the older version, but you still need to create a new
                         version to mark this change in git:
                         git commit -a -m "Restore files to previous version"

Perhaps you've edited the document in three steps: 1) Adding an abstract,
2) Updating your acknowledgements, 3) Adding in a figure. At each step you've
created a new version in git, but now you decide that you din't really want to
update your acknowledgements. Unfortunatey this is sandwiched between other changes
so a simply rollback like "checkout" won't do. Fear not, because git is clever
enough to do what you want, with the revert command:
REVERT EARLIER CHANGES: git revert ID
                        git revert 11b7dd6bbb05f5bee771eb8d889df37989c1c240
                        NOTE: git revert undoes the changes introduced by the
                              version that you pass to it. It does not revert
                              the project to that version. To put the whole
                              project back to a previous version, use git checkout.
